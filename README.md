Most of the code and inverse kinematics for the robotic arm me and my friends are building.

The robotic arm has 6 degrees of freedom and is intended to serve as a personal assistant in the home. It will help people with tasks like cutting vegetables and pouring drinks. 

The invkin.py script handles all the inverse kinematics of the project. For a live demo of part of the inverse kinematics go here: http://rationalash.github.io/invkin/
For the real arm, the inverse kinematics involves a third dimension and a few rotating joints. I have yet to add this functionality to the processing script I used to make this simulation. It's a low priority task right now. Tweaking the real world performance of the arm is taking up most of my time.

The first prototype of the arm has been made. Photos of this prototype will be uploaded
soon. :)
